# About

Welcome to the *Metradica* project Github.

This repository supports all code and documentation about the project.

The global objectives of *Metradica* are to estimate species vulnerability to climate change and predict shifts in species distribution from species traits. The project is lead by Clement Stahl and Ghislain Vieilledent.

It combines: current species distribution, hydrological indices, climatic predictions, and use a few key traits at the individual level in innovative models (joint species distribution model; JSDMs), in order to better understand the processes by which species interact with their environment.

Part of my PhD project is included in the METRADICA strategic project. **Mechanistic traits to predict shifts in tree species abundance and distribution with climate change in the Amazonian forest.**

Have a nice reading !
